Creating HTML emails that will look awesome on the dozens of email programs out there is tricky as many HTML and CSS properties used in modern web design are not supported in email.
Today you are presented with the challenge (opportunity) to code an email HTML template from scratch using "old-school" HTML and inline CSS.

Getting Started
Navigate to your "class projects" folder (where we will be placing assignments). 
NOTE: Start from your home directory "~". 
$ cd "desktop/class projects"
Download the project zip folder. $ git clone https://github.com/SJCCodeTalk/simple-html-email.git
Extract the zip contents. (You may now discard the downloaded .zip file after extraction.)
Use the instructions and assets found therein to create your HTML newsletter email.
Upon completion submit via email to: codetalk@stjosephctr.org.
NOTE: Regarding Submission
Please use the "how to" instructions found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsMSqhMlfao to turn in work. We recommend emailing it to yourself before sending it to us to ensure your email html is displaying correctly.
